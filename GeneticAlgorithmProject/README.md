# How I worked on this project

### This was a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS) project assigned to me and my partner in our Artificial Intelligence (AI) course. The fundamentals of what the project should look like were given by the instructor and we had to build a program around that. I was the one who took the responsibility of coding this project since I had more experience in my python compared to my partner.

# How to navigate this project

### This is a pretty simple and easy to navigate program since there is only one project file which has all the functions in it.

# Why I built the project this way

### From my experience and knowledge in python, it is a usual best practice to keep everything in a single file unlike all other OOP languages such as Java or C/C++. Creating multiple .py files would only create more problems for the code so I followed the advice of keeping all the classes in a single file.

# If I had more time I would change this

### I can defintely see this application with a fun UI. I wouldn't mind creating a reactJS file for this application and pushing it to be a full-stack development app.
